# Bruteforce-Table-Generator
A java program that generates files of keys for brute forcing a password

This is a little fun program that I wrote that, based on the user's desires concerning length, will generate text files of brute force keys that could in theory be used in another program to brute force a password though in reality this would be extremely inefficient, I like writing programs that can generate things!
